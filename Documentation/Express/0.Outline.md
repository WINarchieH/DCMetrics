## General Structure

The express server is structured with the following:

- [api.js](../../Express/api.js): This file is for specifying the address of the DC4 backend.
- [server.js](../../Express/server.js): This file is for defining cookie settings and connecting routes together.
-  routes: There are subdirectories which define routes for particular cases, such as logging in and making requests to the DC4 backend for particular screens.

`Axios` is used for sending requests.

## Server: Cookie Behaviour

Cookie behaviour can be defined in [api.js](../../Express/api.js).
Specifically, 

```javascript 
    app.use(session({
    genid: function(req) { // Function for generating session id
        return uuid.v4()
    }, 
    secret: 'dcmetrics',
    cookie: {
        maxAge: 600000,  // Cookie expires ater 10 minutes of inactivity
        secure: false,  // Set to true if using HTTPS
    },
    resave: false,
    saveUninitialized: false, // Only save sessions when logged in (when session state changes)
    rolling: true    // Cookies maxAge resets after every response
    }));
```

**Note.** In production, it's receommended to change the secret. 

## Server: Session State

When a request is sent to the Express server, the sender is assigned and given a `session id` to identify it.
So the Express server is able to recognise repeat requests from the same sender if the sender sends the same `session id` in each of the following requests.
Hence, it is important to send cookies with each request to the express server to maintain the session state.

### Session Storage

Information can be stored in a session. 
This information is stored **on** express, meaning the frontend will not have access to this information but may retrieve this information from exress.

```javascript
    let variable = //information to assign to session 
    req.session.VARIABLE_NAME = variable // assigning variable to VARIABLE_NAME 
    ...
    req.session.VARIABLE_NAME // retrieving value later
```



## Routing

Routes can be constructed as follows 

```javascript
    const express = require('express');
    const router = express.Router()

    router.get('/PATH', (req,res) => {
        // Processing
        res.send(DATA)
    });

    router.post('/PATH1', (req,res) => {
        // Code
    });

    module.exports = router;
```

In this example, there's a route for a GET and POST request. 
By using router, the entire file can be referenced somwhere else, specifically [server.js](../../Express/server.js).

In [server.js](../../Express/server.js), we can do the following:

```javascript
    const express = require('express');
    const app = express();
    // Other packages
    ...
    const routes = require('../PATH_TO_ABOVE_EXAMPLE');

    app.use('/PARENT_PATH', routes);
```

Now the GET request can be accessed by calling `IP_ADDRESS/PARENT_PATH/PATH` and the POST request can be accessed by `IP_ADDRESS/PARENT_PATH/PATH1`.

### Comments

There are additional features that can be used in Express.

- `app.all('/*', function)`: This means all requests types that match the route path will run this. In this case, `/*` means all routes must go through this. 
- In some scenarios, we may want all requests to be processed by a function beforehand such as appending information.
We can define this function and assign it using `app.use(function)`.
For example, looking at [maintenance.js](../../Express/routesScreens/maintenance.js)

```javascript 
    const appendSite = (req, res, next) => {
        if (req.method === 'POST' || req.method === 'GET') {
            req.body.Site = req.session.Site;
        }
        next();
    };

    router.use(appendSite);
```

This code adds the `Site` to the body of every request.

- Ordering matters. If two routes had the same request type and route, then the first one will be run first and if it doesn't finish, then the second one runs.
This is useful in the case above, where we want to append the user's site to each request body. 
This is also used to check if a user is logged in to be discussed [below](#User-Session).


## User Session

Maintaining a user's logged in state is achieved as follows:

- A successfully logged in user will have a `User` variable assigned to its session 
- Every following request by the user will go through this code block 

```javascript 
    app.all('/*', (req,res,next) => {
    console.log(req.session);
    if (req.session.User) {
        next();
    }
    else {
        res.status('401').send({
        auth: 'Failure'
        });
    }
    });
```

This means only users who have logged in will be able to successfully continue.
Otherwise, a failure response is sent. 
This means every request unrelated to logging in will go through this check beforehand to ensure there is no improper access.

- If a user closes their tab, they may still be logged in and will automatically relog back in when they reopen the browser unless the timer expired (10 minutes).
- To ensure that a user is fully logged out, they must click the log out button which will run the following code to destroy the user session 

```javascript 
    router.get('/Logout', (req, res) => { // Log out - Destroy session.
        if (req.session.User) {
            req.session.destroy();
            res.send({
                message: 'Logged Out'
            });
        }
    });
```


## CORS

In order to enable CORS, the `cors` package is used.

```javascript 
    const cors = require('cors');
    ...
    let whitelist = ['http://localhost:3000','','http://192.168.1.87:1000','http://192.168.1.87:3000','http://192.168.1.107:3000',
                  'https://localhost:3000','http://192.168.1.80:3000','http://10.16.33.90:121'];
    ...
    app.use(cors({ 
    origin: function (origin, callback) {
        if (whitelist.indexOf(origin) !== -1) {
        callback(null, true)
        } else {
        callback(new Error('Not allowed by CORS'))
        }
    }, // Set to React URL
    credentials: true                // Passes the header
    }));
```

The `whitelist` provides a list of URLs where express can send requests to without issues.

## Extensions 

It is recommended to change to session storage from default to another, such as MongoDB, since the default only stores sessions locally.
This means when the express server restarts or stops, all session information is lossed.
