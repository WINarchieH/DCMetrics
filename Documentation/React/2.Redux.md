# 2. Redux Documentation 

[Return to React Outline](0.Outline.md)

Redux is used for 

- Storing session information 
- Maintaining session information across screens

Redux **does not** 

- Maintain session information across tabs 

**Note.** Session information across tabs are achieved using session storage on **Express** and 
is retrieved in [PrivateRoutes](../../React/src/components/routes/privateRoute.js).
More information can be found in [Routing](5.Routing.md#PrivateRoute).

## General Structure

The workflow for adding a variable/action to Redux is the following:

- Define a **variable name** and an **action** that is applied to the variable in [actions](../../React/src/redux/actions.js).
- Specify the **action** name in [actionTypes](../../React/src/redux/actionTypes.js). (This is mainly so that all the defined actions can be quickly found.)
- Define how the **action** works and possible **default values** for the variable involved in a new `.js` file in the [reducers directory](../../React/src/redux/reducers/). 
This will be a function and is called a *reducer*.
- Specify the newly defined reducer in the [index reducer file](../../React/src/redux/reducers/index.js). 
This exposes the action so that it can be used in any screen to retrieve session information.

### Example 

```javascript
    // actionTypes.js 
    export const ACTION_NAME = 'ACTION_NAME';
    // actions.js 
    import { ACTION_NAME, ... } from './actionTypes';
    /// Passing a value
    export const actionName = variable => ({
        type: ACTION_NAME,
        body: { variable }
    });
    // ./reducers/variable.js 
    import { ACTION_NAME } from './actionTypes';
    const initialState = INITIAL_VALUES;

    export const variable = (state=initialState, action) => {
        switch (action.type) {
            case ACTION_NAME: {
                return action.body.variable;
            }
            default: {
                return state;
            }
        }
    };
```

In this example, `variable` is stored in Redux and the *action* associated 
with the variable is replaced a new value.
The *action* may also be related to the current stored value in some way 
such as a counter for the number of visits. 

```javascript 
    const initialState = 0;
    export const variable = (state=initialState, action) => {
        switch (action.type) {
            case ACTION_NAME: {
                return state + action.body.variable;
            }
            default: {
                return state;
            }
        }
    };
```

This definition can be used as a counter starting from 0 and increasing 
with each call to **ACTION_NAME**.

## Storing Session Information 

To store session information, we must 

- import the `useDispatch` hook 
- import the action associated with the variable to update 
- define the `dispatch` variable 
- call the action to update the session information 

The following example refers to the actions defined in the previous section.

```javascript
    import {useDispatch} from 'react-redux';
    import {actionName} from '[file-path]/actions';

    const ReactElement = () => {
        const dispatch = useDispatch();
        ...
        { // Section to update variable
            dispatch(actionName(updateValue));
        }
        ...
    };
```

## Retrieving Session Information 

To retrieve session information, we must 

- import the `useSelector` hook

### Example 

```javascript
    import {useSelector} from 'react-redux';

    const ReactElement = () => {
        const variable = useSelector(store => store.variable);s
    };
```

## Other Information 

Additional information that may be useful to know.

- Redux is linked to the React application in the [index file](../../React/src/index.js).
- The [store file](../../react/src/redux/store.js) combines the functions and associated variable names together. (No need to make changes unless the filesystem changes. eg. moving files outside the redux file).
- Session storage must be manually wiped when logging out as otherwise the information may persist when logging out and in. 
This information wipe occurs in the [index reducer file](../../React/src/redux/reducers/index.js) where the overall state can be changed.

## Useful Tools

The following are useful tools:
