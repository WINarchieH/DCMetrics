## General Structure

To add a route/page in React, a path must be exposed in the [route file](../../React/src/components/routes/routes.js).
This involves 

- Adding a `<Route>` or `<PrivateRoute>` tag
- Specifying a path
- Associating the path with a page/screen

**Note.** 

- `Route` is used if the screen has **unrestricted** access.
- `PrivateRoute` is used if the screen requires permissions. eg. Manager, or logged in.


### Example 

```html
    <Switch>
        ...
        <PrivateRoute path='/ScreenPath' name='Screen Name' exact component={Screen}/>
        ...
        <Route path='/UniqueScreenPath' component={ScreenComponent/> 
        ...
    </Switch>
```

## PrivateRoute

`PrivateRoute` is used for screens which have limited access. 
The main functionalities of this is:

- Redirect users who are **not** logged in to the login page
- Redirect **logged in** users who don't have access to a screen (eg. accessing via URL) to the dashboard
- Initialising a logged in user's session state (user name, navbar, site) when accessing a screen on refresh/new tab


## Additional Information

Since React was developed as a single page application framework, additional packages are needed 
in order to change pages.
Specifically, 

- `react-router-dom` is used 
- `BrowserRouter` is used in the [app file](../../React/src/components/app/App.js) 

are used to ensure routing is possible.
